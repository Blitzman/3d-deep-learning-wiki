## Theoretical Background

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Check out the nice Stanford CS course titled [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/). There is a nice lecture on [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs / ConvNets)](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) which provides an architectural overview as well as detailed explanations of the different layers and popular architectures.

A nice collection of final reports by the course students is available [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports.html). The following ones are specially remarkable:

- [Tiny ImageNet Challenge - Dissection of a convolutional neural network](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/jbboin_finalreport.pdf). Explains a simple architecture and dissects it with useful insight. Besides, the figures are nice and can serve as inspiration.
- [Learning 3D Object Orientations From Synthetic Images](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/rqi_final_report.pdf). Cool approach to mix 3D training data (which is converted to 2D) with 2D input images for object orientation detection.
- [Convolutional Neural Networks for Fashion Classification and Object Detection](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/BLAO_KJAG_CS231N_FinalPaperFashionClassification.pdf). Multiple object detection in the same image, instead of single object per image.

### Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

## Frameworks

### Torch

[Torch](http://torch.ch/) is a scientific computing framework which supports a wide variety of machine learning algorithms. Characterized by an easy use thanks to its LuaJIT scripting language. It also features significant efficiency due to the underlying CUDA/C implementation.

- [Object detection with Recursive Convolutional Neural Network and Lua](https://github.com/fmassa/object-detection.torch)

### Caffe

[Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/) is a deep learning framework developed by the [Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC)](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu/). It is implemented mainly in C++ and supports GPU computing thanks to CUDA.
